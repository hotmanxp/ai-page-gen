# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Fix TypeScript compilation errors in the AI page generation backend service, specifically related to incorrect usage of the `fs.readFile` method.

## Key Knowledge
- The project uses a backend service built with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript
- The backend has routes defined in `src/routes/pageRoutes.ts` for page generation and management
- The project uses both native Node.js `fs` module and `fs-extra` library for file operations
- There were TypeScript errors due to incorrect usage of `fs.readFile` method in `pageRoutes.ts`
- The `fs-extra` library is already included as a dependency in package.json
- File service implementation in `src/services/fileService.ts` correctly uses `fs-extra`

## Recent Actions
- Identified TypeScript compilation errors in `src/routes/pageRoutes.ts` related to `fs.readFile` usage
- Fixed the issue by changing the import from `fs` to `fs-extra` to maintain consistency with the file service implementation
- This resolves the compilation errors since `fs-extra` returns Promises directly, unlike native `fs` which requires callbacks

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Fixed fs module import in pageRoutes.ts to use fs-extra
2. [DONE] Verified that fs-extra is already in package.json dependencies
3. [TODO] Test the backend service to ensure it starts correctly without compilation errors
4. [TODO] Verify that all file operations in pageRoutes.ts work as expected with the fs-extra library
